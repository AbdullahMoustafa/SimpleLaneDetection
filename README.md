# SimpleLaneDetection
In this project, you will be writing code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream (really just a series of images). To complete this project, we used the tools we learned about in Udacity self-driving cars nanodegree, and build upon them. Our first goal is to write code including a series of steps (pipeline) that identify and draw the lane lines on a few test images. We successfully identify the lines in an image, then we wrote a code into the block provided to run on a video stream. The algorithm we used to detect the lanes divided into functions that will be running on the test video “test2.mp4” there is five functions used which are canny, region_of_interest, make_coordinates, average_slope_intercept, and display_lines. Python programming was our language to write the code and we used some popular modules as OpenCV, NumPy, and matplotlib. Finally, this report will discuss all those functions and how we implement mathematics, programming and computer vision to our real-life use to be a part of our final project “Self-driving car”.
